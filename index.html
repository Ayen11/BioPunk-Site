                <p>
                    BioPunk is a story driven 2D psychological horror game which utilizes point and click elements to create and tell a compelling and immersive tale which includes puzzles, 
                    mini-games and compelling conversation with NPCs. The game explores the subject of abandonment and decline by highlighting a grandeur vs. 
                    loss dichotomy following a great war between nature and man.

                        <li><span>Idiotic the game</span><br>3D movement fps video game solo developed with unreal engine 4-5 and published to steam. 
                            Basically I’ve done everything in that game except for the font, the music and some of the textures. I’ve modelled characters for animations. 
                            Builts pipelines to rig, animate and export them to UE. Programmed the movement, weapons, XP, procedural map generation, Enemy AI systems and more.<br> 
                            Worked with the player base in realtime on how to create better looking environments (I worked, they gave feedback). 
                            Recruited and managed playtesting groups. Did market research and recorded and edited trailers and poster art for the game. 
                            Most viral posts have reached 2.3M views on Gifycat (and 3.4M views on Reddit). This and more was my first ever experience with game development.
